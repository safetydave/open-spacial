## Running Submission

For now, see [exploratory notebook documentation](blob/master/doc/OpenSpacial.pdf). Proper executable solution coming so I can play around with migrating and testing notebooks and Andy can see test commits.

## Results

From a selected run:
```
Number of samples for each p: 10000
1.0 0.0
0.9 0.0
0.8 0.0
0.7 0.0
0.6 0.0053
0.5 0.0773

0.3 0.8358
0.2 0.9712
0.1 0.9967
0.0 1.0
```

Confidence interval (95%) for population proportions < +-0.01

## Awesomeness Criteria

1. See Results.
2. See code. Using abstractions with python libraries, visualisations, and additional statistical analysis.
3. Hopefully enough this time.
4. Plan to work on the go script...
